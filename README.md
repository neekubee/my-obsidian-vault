# About
- **Hello**, I am Nikko Bonganay
- I use Obsidian as my knowledge management system, named Life Hub
- External (e.g. Social Media, News, Books) and Internal (e.g. Thoughts, Opinions, Experiences) are all included inside my vault
- For tasks management, I use Todoist
- For note-taking, I use OneNote and RemNote
- For my contributions to this world, I use various platforms like google sites, google blogger, medium, wordpress etc.
- My main purpose for this github page is to share my obsidian use case since most community plugins are shared here.
